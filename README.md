# custom-namalsk

!IMPORTANT! Be sure to back up original files before adding these to your server!  

These files are just a custom area in the southwest part of namalsk that is normally desolate that I decided to added some buildings and a heli crash

This package contains config files and map edit so you can properly add these custom buildings with loot and zombies to your server if you wish.

.zip contains the following files needed to integrate this custom namalsk location and buildings to your server:

- env/zombie_territories.xml - adds zombie coordinates to specific custom area of map
- areaflags.map - tells server where you want zombies spawned
- init.c - adds the buildings and their coordinates using init.c
- mapgrouppos.xml - adds proper positioning of new buildings
- mapgroupproto.xml - adds new buildings aren't part of namalsk default set
